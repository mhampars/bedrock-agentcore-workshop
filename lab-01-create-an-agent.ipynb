    "## Lab 1: Creating a simple customer support agent prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) helps you deploying and operating AI agents securely at scale - using any framework and model. It provides you with the capability to move from prototype to production faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this 5-labs tutorial, we will demonstrate the end-to-end journey from prototype to production using a **Customer Support Agent**. For this example we will use [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/), a simple-to-use, code-first framework for building agents and the Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.7 model from Amazon Bedrock. For your application you can use the framework and model of your choice. It's important to note that the concepts covered here can be applied using other frameworks and models as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop Journey:**\n",
    "- **Lab 1 (Current)**: Create Agent Prototype - Build a functional customer support agent\n",
    "- **Lab 2**: Enhance with Memory - Add conversation context and personalization\n",
    "- **Lab 3**: Scale with Gateway & Identity - Share tools across agents securely\n",
    "- **Lab 4**: Deploy to Production - Use AgentCore Runtime with observability\n",
    "- **Lab 5**: Build User Interface - Create a customer-facing application\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first lab, we'll build a Customer Support Agent prototype that will evolve throughout the workshop into a production-ready system serving multiple customers with persistent memory, shared tools, and full observability. Our agent will have the following local tools available:\n",
    "- **get_return_policy()** - Get return policy for specific products\n",
    "- **get_product_info()** - Get product information\n",
    "- **web_search()** - Search the web for troubleshooting help\n",
    "- **get_technical_support()** - Search a Bedrock Knowledge Base\n",

      "### Immediate Checks:\n",
      "1. **Power Cable Connections**: \n",
      "   - Ensure the power adapter is firmly connected to both the laptop and the wall outlet\n",
      "   - Check for any visible damage to the cable or adapter\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Power Outlet**: \n",
      "   - Verify the power outlet is working by plugging in another device\n",
      "   - Try connecting your laptop to a different outlet\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Power Cable**: \n",
      "   - If available, try using a different compatible power adapter\n",
      "   - Look for any bent pins or damage to the connection points\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Physical Inspection**:\n",
      "   - Check for any visible physical damage to the laptop\n",
      "   - Look for liquid damage indicators (usually small white/red dots that change color when exposed to liquid)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Troubleshooting:\n",
      "- Try removing the battery (if removable) and holding the power button for 30 seconds, then reconnect everything\n",
      "- Connect the power adapter without the battery installed (if possible) to see if it's a battery issue\n",
      "- Check if any lights come on when plugged in, even if the screen remains dark\n",
      "\n",
      "If these steps don't resolve the issue, your laptop may require professional service. Since your ThinkPad X1 Carbon comes with a 1-year manufacturer warranty, this issue should be covered if you're within the warranty period.\n",
      "\n",

      "Based on the information I've gathered, here are some solutions for your iPhone 14 overheating issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why Your iPhone 14 Might Be Heating Up:\n",
      "1. **Resource-intensive apps and processes** - Gaming, video streaming, or GPS navigation\n",
      "2. **Background apps** consuming excessive resources\n",
      "3. **Software issues** or bugs (especially after iOS updates)\n",
      "4. **Environmental factors** - Direct sunlight or high ambient temperatures\n",
      "5. **Charging while using** resource-intensive applications\n",
      "6. **Case-related issues** - Some cases can trap heat\n",
      "\n",
      "### Solutions to Try:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Update iOS to the Latest Version**\n",
      "   - Go to Settings > General > Software Update\n",
      "   - Install any available updates as they often include thermal management improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Manage Background Apps**\n",
      "   - Close unused apps by swiping up from the bottom and swiping them away\n",
      "   - Check Settings > Battery to see which apps are consuming the most power\n",
      "   - Disable Background App Refresh: Settings > General > Background App Refresh\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Adjust Settings to Reduce Heat**\n",
      "   - Lower screen brightness\n",
      "   - Turn off unnecessary features like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when not in use\n",
      "   - Disable location services for apps that don't need it (Settings > Privacy > Location Services)\n",
      "   - Enable Low Power Mode: Settings > Battery\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Charging Best Practices**\n",
      "   - Remove the case while charging\n",
      "   - Use official Apple chargers or certified accessories\n",
      "   - Avoid using the phone while it's charging\n",
      "   - Don't charge in hot environments\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Environmental Considerations**\n",
      "   - Keep your iPhone out of direct sunlight\n",
      "   - Don't leave it in hot environments (like a car on a sunny day)\n",
      "   - Use your phone in temperature-controlled environments when possible\n",

      "- Refund will be processed within 5-7 business days after inspection\n",
